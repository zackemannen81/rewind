  Task: GAMEPLAY-003 Implement New Bosses
  Plan:
    1) Audit existing boss framework (Spawner, WaveDirector, enemy patterns) to map required hooks.
    2) Design Swarm/Juggernaut/Trickster behaviours and define reusable data-driven configs.
    3) Implement boss entities, patterns, and announcer/audio cues.
    4) Integrate bosses into wave playlists and difficulty tuning.
    5) Build/regress tests or simulations exercising boss phases.
  Validation:
    - pnpm test -i (boss behaviour suites if feasible)
  Risks:
    - New boss patterns could destabilise pacing or performance if badly tuned.
  Evidence:
    - Pending
  Next:
    - Prepare feature branch and baseline checks

2025-10-11 05:05 CEST — codex
Role: Producer/PM, Senior Core Engineer
Sprint: Phase A Kickoff (Sprint 1)
Summary:
  - Pulled latest main and ensured dependencies are up to date (`npm install`).
  - `npm run test` currently exits with no test files; logged as baseline for CORE-016/QA to address.
  - Confirmed focus for Sprint 1: CORE-006/007/008/009/015 and UI-004 prototype work.
Next Steps:
  - Senior Core Engineer to draft implementation plan for CORE-006 and CORE-007.
  - Tools/Systems pair to scope modular restructure (CORE-009) before moving files.
  - UI Engineer to prepare Rhythm Ring HUD spike (UI-004) once BeatClock scaffolding is ready.
2025-10-11 05:20 CEST — codex
Role: Senior Core Engineer
Task: CORE-006 / CORE-007 Planning
Notes:
  - Audited current beat pipeline (`GameScene`, `AudioAnalyzer`, `BeatWindow`).
  - Authored `docs/design/phaseA_core_systems.md` outlining EventBus API, BeatClock responsibilities, migration steps, and open questions.
  - Next: scaffold `src/core/EventBus.ts` and `src/audio/BeatClock.ts`, coordinate with gameplay/UI for integration order.
2025-10-11 05:32 CEST — codex
Role: Senior Core Engineer
Tasks: CORE-006, CORE-007
Notes:
  - Added scaffolding files `src/core/EventBus.ts` and `src/audio/BeatClock.ts` per design doc.
  - Tagged primary integration points (`GameScene`, `AudioAnalyzer`, `HUD`) with TODO comments referencing upcoming replacements.
  - Ready to proceed with concrete implementations once dependencies (latency service planning) align.
2025-10-11 05:45 CEST — codex
Role: Senior Core Engineer
Tasks: CORE-006, CORE-007
Notes:
  - Implemented `EventBus` with typed pub/sub, once, clear, and scene binding helper.
  - Implemented `BeatClock` with beat scheduling, EventBus emissions, latency setters, and analyzer sync method.
  - `npm run test` still exits due to absent test files; to be addressed when QA introduces coverage.
Next:
  - Draft integration guidance and coordinate with Gameplay/UI to consume new services.
2025-10-11 06:05 CEST — codex
Role: Senior Core Engineer, Gameplay Engineer, UI Engineer
Tasks: CORE-006, CORE-007, UI-004 groundwork
Notes:
  - Integrated `BeatClock` into `GameScene`; low-beat logic now driven by analyzer sync while BeatClock emits global events (`beat:band`, `beat:tick`).
  - Added EventBus emission for beat bands and updated HUD to listen via EventBus instead of direct scene calls.
  - Build check (`npm run build`) completes after ~26s; reports longstanding duplicate method warnings unrelated to current change.
Next:
  - Wire remaining gameplay systems (wave director, combo logic) to EventBus where appropriate.
  - Begin restructuring combo accuracy to leverage BeatClock windows (GAMEPLAY-013) in upcoming iteration.
2025-10-11 06:18 CEST — codex
Role: Gameplay Engineer, Senior Core Engineer
Tasks: GAMEPLAY-013, CORE-007
Notes:
  - `GameScene` now derives shot timing from `BeatClock` (`msSinceLastBeat`) and classifies judgements via a new helper.
  - Combo tracking resets when hits fall outside BeatClock’s good window (`goodWindowMs`), preparing for multiplier tuning.
  - `BeatClock` exposes `msSinceLastBeat`/`msUntilNextBeat` to support accuracy logic.
  - Build run (`npm run build`) completes with existing duplicate-method warnings; execution hits 30s timeout but artifacts emit successfully.
Next:
  - Tweak `perfectWindowMs`/`goodWindowMs` based on playtest feedback and hook combo multiplier into scoring service.
  - Coordinate with UI engineer to surface new accuracy states in HUD.
2025-10-11 06:34 CEST — codex
Role: Gameplay Engineer
Task: GAMEPLAY-013 follow-up
Notes:
  - BeatClock-driven combo logic now emits `combo:changed` for resets and streaks; HUD still reads multiplier from scoring.
  - Build command continues to succeed with existing duplicate-method warnings after ~40s (timeout in automation, but artifacts produced).
Pending:
  - Align `Scoring` multiplier updates with EventBus combo stream so HUD multiplier reflects BeatClock accuracy.
2025-10-11 06:45 CEST — codex
Role: Gameplay Engineer
Tasks: GAMEPLAY-013
Notes:
  - Scoring now exposes `updateCombo`/`resetCombo`; GameScene calls these when beat-driven combo events fire, keeping multiplier in sync with HUD and EventBus.
  - Auto-expiring combos, player hits, and enemy escapes all reset multiplier through Scoring to avoid stale UI state.
  - `npm run build` succeeds (~27s) with existing duplicate-method warnings.
Next:
  - UI team to reflect multiplier changes visually (UI-004) and QA to add BeatClock accuracy tests.
2025-10-11 06:55 CEST — codex
Role: Senior Core Engineer
Task: CORE-008 Planning
Notes:
  - Drafted `docs/design/phaseA_latency_service.md` outlining LatencyService API, calibration flow, and integration steps with BeatClock/EventBus.
  - Next: scaffold `src/systems/LatencyService.ts` and apply offset during GameScene BeatClock setup.
2025-10-11 07:05 CEST — codex
Role: Senior Core Engineer
Task: CORE-008 Implementation
Notes:
  - Added `LatencyService` (src/systems/LatencyService.ts) with calibration sampling, offset persistence, and `latency:changed` EventBus emission.
  - GameScene now initializes BeatClock with the stored latency offset and listens for latency changes to update the clock on the fly.
  - Build passes (`npm run build` ~27s) with known duplicate-method warnings.
Next:
  - Hook LatencyService into future ProfileService (CORE-010) and UI calibration wizard (UI-011).
2025-10-11 07:20 CEST — codex
Role: UI Engineer
Task: UI-004 HUD v2
Notes:
  - Introduced `RhythmRing` (`src/ui/RhythmRing.ts`) driven by EventBus beat events; HUD now renders the ring and BeatCoin tracker, and reacts to latency-adjusted beats.
  - HUD listens to `beat:tick`, `beat:window`, `currency:changed`; combo, multiplier, and BeatCoin text update immediately.
  - Accessibility hooks updated (`setReducedMotion`, new `setColorblindMode`) to propagate to the rhythm visuals.
Next:
  - Polish combo/multiplier styling and integrate ability meters in later passes.
2025-10-11 07:28 CEST — codex
Role: Senior Core Engineer
Task: CORE-010 Planning
Notes:
  - Authored `docs/design/phaseA_profile_service.md` to define ProfileService responsibilities, API, and EventBus events.
  - Next: Implement in-memory ProfileService with default profile and profile change events.
2025-10-11 07:40 CEST — codex
Role: Senior Core Engineer
Task: CORE-010 Implementation
Notes:
  - Implemented ProfileService (`src/systems/ProfileService.ts`) with create/switch/rename/delete flows, in-memory persistence, and `profile:changed/updated` events.
  - GameScene now consumes latency offsets via ProfileService through LatencyService during stage init.
  - Build (`npm run build`) succeeds ~26s; duplicate-world-bounds warnings cleared.
Next:
  - Wire ProfileService serialization into upcoming SaveService once CORE-010/011 continue.
2025-10-11 07:48 CEST — codex
Role: Senior Core Engineer
Task: CORE-010 Save Service
Notes:
  - Implemented SaveService (`src/systems/SaveService.ts`) with schema versioning, backup rotation, and localStorage fallback.
  - ProfileService now loads/saves profiles via SaveService with debounced persistence and profile-change auto-save.
  - Build (`npm run build`) successful (~25s) with expected asset-size warnings only.
Next:
  - Surface profile switching in UI (UI-008) and allow manual save triggers once menus land.
2025-10-11 08:05 CEST — codex
Role: UI Engineer, Gameplay Engineer
Tasks: UI-008, GAMEPLAY-013 follow-up
Notes:
  - Replaced the old ProfileSystem with ProfileService-backed UI: ProfileScene now lists profiles, supports create/rename/delete, and shows stats/achievements from profile data.
  - ResultScene writes run stats and achievements into ProfileService and reuses profile names for leaderboard prompts.
  - MenuScene displays the active profile name for context.
  - Build timeout occurred (~90s) but Vite completed successfully; same asset-size warnings persist.
Next:
  - Expose profile switching controls in main menu options and surface autosave status if needed.
2025-10-11 08:20 CEST — codex
Roles: UI Engineer, Senior Core Engineer
Tasks: UI-011, UI-008
Notes:
  - Added LatencyCalibrationScene with countdown/sampling/preview flow leveraging RhythmRing and LatencyService; OptionsScene now launches it via a dedicated row.
  - ProfileScene refreshed to list profiles with create/rename/delete actions and show stats/achievements from ProfileService.
  - ResultScene writes run stats/achievements back to ProfileService; MenuScene displays the active profile.
  - Build (`npm run build`) succeeded (≈53s) after timeout; only known asset size warnings remain.
Next:
  - Polish calibration visuals and add confirmation messaging; hook profile management into menu buttons for quicker access.
2025-10-11 08:32 CEST — codex
Roles: UI Engineer, Gameplay Engineer
Tasks: UI-011 polish, UI-012 ability overlay
Notes:
  - LatencyCalibrationScene now features countdown visuals, real-time sample feedback, apply/ retry shortcuts, and automatic profile updates when an offset is saved; OptionsScene refreshes on wake and uses profile latency settings.
  - Introduced AbilityOverlay component in HUD showing bomb charge and placeholder ability cooldown arcs; GameScene currently feeds mocked ability data pending gameplay integration.
  - Menu/Options build verified (`npm run build` ~33s) with expected asset-size warnings.
Next:
 - Replace mocked ability data with real ability state once the gameplay framework lands.
  - Apply design polish to the latency wizard (graphics/audio cues) and expose manual save feedback to the player.
2025-10-11 09:20 CEST — codex
Roles: UI Engineer, Gameplay Engineer
Tasks: UI-012, GAMEPLAY-016 groundwork
Notes:
  - Wired AbilityService to profile loadouts and EventBus, replacing the placeholder timers so HUD overlays track real cooldown/active windows.
  - Added profile-level ability defaults (Pulse Dash, Overdrive) with Q/R and LB/Y bindings plus gamepad latching, emitting true ability states back to the UI.
  - Implemented Pulse Dash dash/invulnerability burst and Overdrive rapid-fire buff via existing Powerups, refreshing AbilityOverlay visuals with status arcs, input hints, and beat-ready flashes.
  - `npm run build` passes (~73s) with only known asset warnings.
Next:
  - Surface ability loadouts in profile menus, allow rebinds, and backfill unit coverage once the QA backlog opens.
2025-10-11 09:55 CEST — codex
Roles: UI Engineer
Tasks: UI-011 polish, UI-008 profile save feedback
Notes:
  - LatencyCalibrationScene now layers countdown rings, progress bars, and confirmation pulses with per-step audio cues; applying an offset shows a beat-synced “saved” toast before returning to Options.
  - Added autosave/manual save status indicators to OptionsScene alongside a `Save Profile Now` row that triggers `ProfileService.saveNow()` via the new `profile:save:*` EventBus signals.
  - ProfileService now emits save pending/completed events, enabling the settings UI to reflect live persistence state.
  - `npm run build` passes (~74s) with standard asset-size warnings.
Next:
  - Thread ability loadout editing into profile/menus, and backfill save-service unit coverage when QA bandwidth opens.
2025-10-11 10:20 CEST — codex
Roles: UI Engineer, Gameplay Engineer
Tasks: UI-012 continuation, UI-008
Notes:
  - ProfileScene now lets players cycle primary/secondary abilities with left/right click, updating ProfileService’s ability loadouts so GameScene consumes real selections.
  - OptionsScene shows the current ability pair alongside the new manual-save control, keeping settings and gameplay bindings aligned.
  - `npm run build` passes (~76s) with the usual asset-size warnings.
Next:
  - Expand the ability roster/rebind UX and add targeted AbilityService/ProfileService unit coverage when QA capacity allows.
2025-10-11 10:32 CEST — codex
Roles: UI Engineer
Tasks: UI-008 profile polish
Notes:
  - MenuScene now supports quick profile switching via bracket keys or on-screen arrows and surfaces autosave/ manual-save status via the new profile save events.
  - Profile header updates immediately when switching, keeping the loadout summary in Options/Profile in sync.
  - `npm run build` passes (~76s) with standard asset-size warnings.
Next:
  - Wire controller-friendly profile switching and integrate ability rebind UI in the upcoming accessibility/settings pass.

Task: CORE-009 Refactor Source Structure into Modular Architecture
Plan:
  1) Analyze current folder structure and tsconfig.json against the task description.
  2) Identify files that need to be moved to align with the documented modular architecture.
  3) Create new directories as needed (e.g., `gameplay/`, `content/`).
  4) Move files to their new locations.
  5) Update `tsconfig.json` with any new path aliases.
  6) Update all necessary imports in the moved files and files that import them.
  7) Run build and lint to ensure everything is working correctly.
  8) Update documentation with the new structure.
Validation:
  - `pnpm run build` should succeed.
  - `pnpm run lint` should pass.
Risks:
  - High risk of breaking imports and causing build failures. Will need to be very careful and systematic.
Next:
  - Create a feature branch and start the refactoring.

2025-10-18 14:30 CEST — Gemini
Task: CORE-015 Add Config Schema Validation
Plan:
  1) Install zod, a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
  2) Create schema definitions for the main configuration files (`balance.json`, `tracks.json`, etc.).
  3) Create a validation script that can be run from the command line.
  4) Integrate the validation script into the build process.
  5) Add documentation for the new validation process.
Validation:
  - `pnpm run test` should run the validation script.
  - The build should fail if a config file is invalid.
Risks:
  - The schemas might become out of sync with the code.
Next:
  - Start by installing zod.
2025-10-11 11:00 CEST — codex
Roles: Producer/PM
Summary:
  - Phase A deliverables (BeatClock/EventBus, latency stack, Save/Profile services, HUD v2, calibration wizard) are merged into `main`. Rhythm core is locked for Sprint 1.
  - Phase B (Player Feel & HUD Feedback) is queued next: focus on movement/dash rewrite (GAMEPLAY-014), bomb rework (GAMEPLAY-017), final HUD polish (UI-004/UI-012), latency wizard refinements (UI-011), and ability integrations.
Next:
  - Kick off Phase B feature work per `docs/design/phaseB_player_feel.md`.
  - Ensure new Sprint planning references updated ProfileService/AbilityService foundations.

*** End of Phase A ***


2025-10-18 17:20 CEST — codex
Roles: Gameplay Engineer
Task: GAMEPLAY-014 Rebuild Player Movement and Dash
Summary:
  - Added configurable movement/dash tuning and difficulty-based hitboxes via `src/config/playerMovement.ts`.
  - Refactored `GameScene` movement to use acceleration/drag curves and beat-synced dash bonuses with gamepad rumble + HUD cues.
  - HUD now surfaces dash feedback and ability overlay reflects updated dash duration copy.
Next:
 - Hook combo-based bomb charge into new movement feedback loops.
  - Evaluate dash window tuning after internal playtest.

2025-10-18 19:05 CEST — codex
Roles: Gameplay Engineer
Task: GAMEPLAY-017 Bomb Rework
Summary:
  - Replaced kill-tick bomb meter with combo-driven tuning (`bombConfig`), scaling charge off perfect hits and draining on damage/beat misses.
  - Bomb activation now checks BeatClock timing; perfect beats wipe the field, near-miss pulses deal heavy damage, and off-beat attempts consume charge with HUD warnings.
  - HUD/Ability overlay gained beat-window cues, bomb readiness messaging, and detonation flashes wired through `HUD.showBombFeedback` and `flashBombDetonate`.
Next:
 - Playtest bomb cadence vs combo pacing; tweak `comboStep`/`missPenalty` once QA has feel notes.
  - Thread bomb readiness into audio mix (sidechain duck) during UI polish pass.

2025-10-18 20:10 CEST — codex
Roles: UI Engineer
Tasks: UI-004, UI-012 HUD polish
Summary:
  - Ability overlay now surfaces cooldown/active timers, binding hints from GameScene, and high-contrast palette toggled via options.
  - HUD bomb meter mirrors beat windows with new readouts and high-contrast styling; dash/bomb feedback copy tuned for accessibility.
  - Profile-driven ability loadouts flow through AbilityService, ensuring overlay stays synced when bindings change.
Next:
  - Audit latency wizard visuals/audio (UI-011) before sprint cutoff.
 - Capture QA impressions on the new status text readability across colorblind/high-contrast modes.

2025-10-18 21:00 CEST — codex
Roles: UI Engineer
Task: UI-011 Latency Wizard Enhancements
Summary:
  - Redesigned calibration flow with step timeline, preview hints, and metronome audio cues powered by BeatClock so players can feel the suggested offset before applying it.
  - Added sample stats (median/avg/spread/std), improved progress visuals, and high-contrast aware styling plus controller-friendly prompts.
  - Confirmation banner now highlights profile updates and keeps the preview looping until players exit or resample.
Next:
  - Verify UX on gamepad (A/R bindings) and gather telemetry on sample spreads to auto-adjust target counts if needed.
  - Revisit UI copy once localization guidelines land in Phase C.
